# AidLink
Hyperlocal board that connects **help requests** and **help offers** without accounts or tracking.

- Post a micro-need (e.g., school laptop, ride to clinic)
- Offer help (e.g., tutoring, translation, rides)
- Search & filter locally (coming in PR 1)
- Privacy-first: no backend, no analytics in core (client-only)

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech
- React (Vite)
- React Router
- Plain CSS (accessible-first)
- Future PRs: JSON schemas, local drafts, shareable links, i18n, CI/CD
